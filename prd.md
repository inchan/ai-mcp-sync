Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction
Product Name: MCP Sync Service
Version: 1.0
Purpose: To automate and simplify the management of AI CLI tool configurations for developers and general users.*
2. Goals
Reduce the time spent on managing AI CLI tool configurations.
Automate the process of synchronizing settings across multiple AI CLI tools.
Provide an open-source, transparent, and reliable service.
Offer an easy-to-use interface for both novice and experienced users.
3. Target Audience
Developers who use AI CLI tools.
Data scientists interested in AI model development and experimentation.
Users who prefer automated configuration management.
Users of various operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux).
Users interested in open-source tools and technologies.*
4. Features
4.1. Core Features
AI CLI Tool Auto-Detection: Automatically detect locally installed AI CLI tools (Claude Desktop, Code, Cursor, etc.).
MCP Configuration Synchronization: Synchronize MCP settings between a master configuration and individual tool configurations (scan, compare, update).
MCP Configuration CRUD: Add, modify, and delete MCP server settings.
Synchronization Status Notification: Provide real-time feedback on synchronization status and results.
AI CLI-Specific Management: Implement functions to extract, remove, and add MCP values for each AI CLI tool.
Local Storage: Store local settings and change history using SQLite.
Rule (Guideline) Synchronization: Synchronize system rules (prompts, rule files) for AI CLI tools.
Automated Configuration: Automatically configure AI CLI tools when they are first installed
4.2. Additional Features
Recommended MCP Server List: Provide a list of recommended MCP servers.
Configuration Backup and Restore: Backup, restore, and manage configuration change history with rollback capabilities.
System Tray Integration: Control synchronization and display status via a system tray menu.
Project-Specific vs. Global Setting Prioritization: Prioritize and merge project-specific settings with global settings.
Automatic Updates: Implement an automatic update system for the application.*
5. Use Cases
A developer wants to ensure that all their AI CLI tools use the same MCP settings to maintain consistency across projects.
A user wants to quickly set up new AI CLI tools with their preferred configurations without manual configuration.
6. Problem Statement
Managing AI CLI tool configurations manually is complex and time-consuming. Users need a way to automate this process and ensure consistency across multiple tools.

7. Proposed Solution
The MCP Sync Service automates the synchronization of AI CLI tool configurations, reducing the time and effort required to manage these settings manually. It provides an open-source, user-friendly solution that works across multiple operating systems and supports a wide range of AI CLI tools.

8. Development Strategy
Development Model: Waterfall
Prioritization: Focus on core features first, then implement additional features based on user feedback.
9. Release Criteria
All core features must be fully implemented and tested.
The application must be stable and reliable.
The user interface must be intuitive and easy to use.
The application must be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.
10. Future Enhancements
Advanced UI: Enhanced UI components for MCP server list, rule template management, and detailed synchronization reports.
Conditional Synchronization and Merge: Advanced logic for prioritizing and merging project-specific vs. global settings.
Cross-Platform Enhancements: Operating system-specific optimizations for permissions and file systems.*
11. Open Issues
How to handle conflicts between different configuration files.
How to ensure the security of sensitive configuration data.
How to scale the service to support a large number of AI CLI tools and users.*
