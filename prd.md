# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
- **Product Name:** MCP Sync Service
- **Version:** 1.1 (Living document)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-20
- **Document Owner:** Product & Engineering Leads
- **Purpose:** Define the product strategy, scope, and success criteria for a cross-platform service that automates the management and synchronization of Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations across AI-focused CLI tools.

## 2. Product Vision & Context
Developers increasingly rely on multiple AI assistants, IDE extensions, and CLI tools that implement the Model Context Protocol. Managing configuration drift across tools is time-consuming, error-prone, and limits experimentation. MCP Sync Service provides a unified way to detect installations, apply consistent configurations, and propagate updates. The service combines automation with transparency so that individuals and teams can trust and audit configuration changes.

## 3. Goals & Non-Goals
### Goals
1. **Consistency:** Maintain consistent MCP server definitions, credentials, and rule sets across supported AI CLI clients with minimal manual work.
2. **Visibility:** Provide actionable feedback about synchronization status, conflicts, and history so users understand what changed and why.
3. **Scalability:** Support multi-environment usage (personal workstation, team-managed laptop) with minimal setup.
4. **Extensibility:** Allow future addition of new AI tools or configuration formats without major rework.

### Non-Goals
- Provide cloud-hosted storage for MCP configs (local-first focus).
- Manage AI model parameters unrelated to MCP endpoints.
- Offer enterprise authentication or RBAC in the initial release.

## 4. Target Audiences & Personas
1. **Solo Developer (Primary):** Maintains multiple AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot CLI) and needs consistent prompts and MCP endpoints across devices.
2. **AI Ops Engineer (Secondary):** Supports a team of data scientists, wants repeatable onboarding with minimal manual editing of configuration files.
3. **Open-Source Contributor (Tertiary):** Evaluates new MCP servers frequently and needs isolated sandboxes and quick rollbacks.

## 5. Key User Journeys
1. **Initial Synchronization:**
   - User installs MCP Sync Service.
   - Application auto-detects supported AI CLI tools, requests confirmation to establish a master configuration, and applies baseline settings.
   - User reviews a summary of synchronized tools and sees success/failure statuses per tool.
2. **Add New MCP Server:**
   - User defines server metadata (name, endpoint, description, access tokens, rule references).
   - System validates configuration, updates the master definition, and propagates to all compatible AI CLI tool configs.
   - History view logs the change and offers rollback.
3. **Resolve Conflict:**
   - A CLI tool changes a config field outside the service.
   - MCP Sync detects the drift, surfaces a diff, and offers options: accept external change, revert, or merge.
   - Metrics update to reflect conflict resolution time and user decision.
4. **Team Onboarding:**
   - Ops engineer exports a recommended profile.
   - Team member imports the profile, runs sync, and receives prompts for missing prerequisites (tokens, permissions).

## 6. BMAD Framework Application
To ensure alignment between business intent and execution, MCP Sync Service applies the **BMAD (Business Outcomes, Metrics, Activities, Deliverables)** framework.

| BMAD Pillar | Description | Application to MCP Sync Service |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Business Outcomes** | Value-driven objectives that justify the investment. | Reduce configuration drift by 80%, cut onboarding time by 50%, increase trust in MCP rule propagation for mixed tool stacks. |
| **Metrics** | Quantitative/qualitative signals that show progress toward the outcomes. | \- Number of synchronized tools per user \- Drift incidents detected/resolved per month \- Time-to-onboard new tool \- User satisfaction/NPS for synchronization clarity |
| **Activities** | Product and engineering initiatives required to move the metrics. | Implement auto-detection adapters, create conflict resolution UX, instrument telemetry & audit logging, publish documentation/templates. |
| **Deliverables** | Concrete artifacts shipped to customers or internal stakeholders. | Desktop tray app, synchronization engine, configuration history viewer, CLI bootstrap script, knowledge base with templates. |

BMAD considerations must be revisited during planning to ensure feature work ladders up to measurable impact.

## 7. Feature Requirements
### 7.1 Core Features (Release v1)
1. **AI CLI Tool Auto-Detection**
   - Detect supported tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code CLI, etc.) using filesystem heuristics and registries per OS.
   - Prompt user approval before modifying configs.
   - Record detected versions and paths for observability.
2. **MCP Configuration Synchronization Engine**
   - Designate a master configuration; read/transform tool-specific formats (JSON, YAML, TOML).
   - Support scan → compare → update pipeline with dry-run preview.
   - Log change sets for rollback; allow per-tool override flags.
3. **Configuration CRUD Interface**
   - Provide UI/CLI to create, edit, duplicate, and delete MCP server definitions, rule sets, and tokens.
   - Validate fields (URL schema, token format) and highlight missing secrets.
4. **Synchronization Status & Notifications**
   - Real-time feedback (toast notifications, tray icon states) for sync completion, errors, drift alerts.
   - Export activity summary to local log and optional JSON for integrations.
5. **Local Storage & History**
   - Persist configuration metadata, sync status, and history diff snapshots using SQLite.
   - Provide retention policy (default 90 days) with manual purge.

### 7.2 Supporting Features (Post v1 or Stretch)
- **Recommended MCP Server Catalog:** Curated templates with metadata, validated weekly.
- **Backup & Restore:** Manual/automatic export of master configuration; schedule-based snapshots.
- **System Tray Controls:** Quick toggle to pause/resume sync, view latest status, open recent conflicts.
- **Project vs Global Profiles:** Allow scoping to workspace-specific overrides merged with global baseline.
- **Automatic Updates:** Optional background updater with release notes.

## 8. Functional Requirements
- **FR-1:** The system shall allow users to run a dry-run sync preview showing differences per tool before applying changes.
- **FR-2:** The system shall maintain an audit log (timestamp, actor, tool, action) for every configuration change.
- **FR-3:** The system shall support rollback to any previous synchronization state within the retention window.
- **FR-4:** The system shall expose command-line operations for headless automation (detect, sync, export, import).
- **FR-5:** The system shall warn users when required secrets are missing and allow secure prompts for input.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Detect and sync configurations for three tools within 5 seconds on a modern laptop; drift check runs must complete within 2 seconds for average file sizes (<100 KB).
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99% successful sync completion rate with automatic retries for transient file locks.
- **Usability:** Provide contextual tooltips and inline documentation for complex fields; support light/dark themes.
- **Security & Privacy:** Never transmit MCP credentials externally; encrypt sensitive fields at rest using OS keychain or encrypted SQLite fields.
- **Observability:** Emit structured logs for detections, sync attempts, and errors; optionally integrate with local telemetry (OpenTelemetry exporter).
- **Portability:** Support macOS, Windows, and Linux with shared core logic and platform-specific adapters.

## 10. Assumptions & Dependencies
- Supported AI CLI tools expose configuration files in accessible locations and predictable formats.
- Users can grant filesystem permissions for tool directories and secure credential storage.
- Network access is only required for checking MCP server availability or updates; core sync works offline.
- Future Tauri/Electron shell will wrap frontend assets for desktop distribution.

## 11. Development Strategy & Timeline
The project follows a milestone-based agile approach anchored by BMAD priorities.

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key BMAD Alignment |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| **Discovery & Instrumentation** | 2 weeks | Validate detection heuristics, define telemetry schema, create UX prototypes. | Establish Metrics baseline and confirm Deliverables scope. |
| **MVP Build** | 6 weeks | Implement core detection, synchronization engine, CRUD interface, and history logging. | Execute Activities that deliver Business outcomes of consistency. |
| **Beta Hardening** | 4 weeks | Add notifications, conflict resolution UX, packaging, and documentation. | Improve Metrics (resolution time, adoption) via UX polish and guidance Deliverables. |
| **Launch & Feedback Loop** | Ongoing | Release public beta, gather user feedback, iterate on adapters, expand catalog. | Maintain Activities that sustain Business outcomes and inform future roadmap. |
